3,Hi Q&A team.  I missed the previous 2 sessions due to a work conflict.  Could someone tell me where to find the recordings so I can make up that material (and how to note my attendance / make-up)?,Gary Linkevich,'-,"You can replace up to two live sessions with the recordings and still qualify for the certificate of completion at the end of the bootcamp. If you miss more than two live sessions, you will need to attend the equivalent session in a future 8-Day Cohort. Please note that any session where you miss more than 15 minutes is considered a missed session.

With that in mind, here are links to the previous two recorded sessions:

81,Hi Dave! I'm new to the Project Management Industry. I noticed on the Pmi website that we have to show documents about past projects and training. What counts as a project I've led?,Avigale de Asis,'-,"Any project where you were leading and directing project activities would qualify. Depending on your education background, you would need a minimum of three to five years of project management experience to qualify for the certification exam.

PMI defines a project as “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result”. If your experience is related to operationsal activities, it would not count. Operationsal activities are ongoing and permanent with a repetitive output.

Here is an article that outlines the difference between operational and project activities that you may find helpful.

It will be verified against the Zoom reports that will be generated for each session by our Certificate Processing department when you request your certificate of completion at that the end of the bootcamp. Missing 15 minutes or less will not affect your attendance for last week's session.

With that in mind, you can replace up to two live sessions with the recordings and still qualify for the certificate of completion at the end of the bootcamp. If you miss more than two live sessions, you will need to attend the equivalent session in a future 8-Day Cohort.",11/14/2022 14:06:37,11/14/2022 14:39:39,

I have tested the direct Zoom link and it is working. It is possible that your organization blocks direct Zoom access from your network. Here is the direct Zoom info that you can use to join from your browser or from the Zoom app just in case you copied and pasted something incorrectly.
